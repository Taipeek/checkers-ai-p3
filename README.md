# Machine Learning - Evaluation Function for Checkers
This project is based on another Github project Checkers-project https://github.com/vikaspro90/Checkers-game.
The original project was translated from Python 2.7 to 3.6.

Generation of the dataset is written in file gamePlayGenerate.
Creating results for the dataset is written in gamePlay.
Evaluation matches are can be played using gamePlayReal.
Training of the neural network is done in CNN_trainingScript.
The model is then exported into file final_net.h5.
